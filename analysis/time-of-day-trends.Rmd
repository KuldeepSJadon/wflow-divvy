Here we use the Divvy trip data to examine biking trends over the
course of a typical day in Chicago.

I begin by loading a few packages, as well as some additional
functions I wrote for this project.

```{r load-packages, message = FALSE}
library(data.table)
library(ggplot2)
source("../code/functions.R")
```

## Read the data

Following [my earlier steps](first-glance.html), I use function
`read.divvy.data` to read the trip and station data from the CSV
files.

```{r load-data}
divvy <- read.divvy.data()
```

To make it easier to compile statistics by time of day, I convert the
"start hour" column to a factor (*i.e.*, categorical variable).

```{r convert-start-hour}
divvy$trips <- transform(divvy$trips,start.hour = factor(start.hour,0:23))
```
<br>

## Count departures by time-of-day

Now that `start.hour` is a factor, it is easy to create a bar chart
showing the total number of departures at each hour.

Unsurprisingly, there is very little biking activity at night.

Further, the two peaks ("modes") in the bar chart nicely recapitulate
the morning and afternoon rush hours.

```{r timeofday-barchart, fig.height = 2.5, fig.width = 5}
ggplot(divvy$trips,aes(start.hour)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "dodgerblue",width = 0.6) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank())
```

This summary is a bit muddled because it is counting trips during the
week and on the weekends. Once we separate the counts by the day of
the week, the rush-hour trends become more striking. (Also notice that
the rush hours disappear on Saturday and Sunday.)

```{r timeofday-barchart-2, fig.height = 6, fig.width = 6}
ggplot(divvy$trips,aes(start.hour)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "dodgerblue",width = 0.75) +
  facet_wrap(~start.day,ncol = 2) +
  scale_x_discrete(breaks = seq(0,24,2)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank())
```

## Time-of-day trends at University of Chicago

The commuting trends are different at the University of Chicago Divvy
station---there isn't much of a morning rush hour. This may be because
students and staff don't regularly use the Divvy bikes for commuting.

```{r timeofday-uchicago-barchart, fig.height = 6, fig.width = 6}
ggplot(subset(divvy$trips,from_station_name == "University Ave & 57th St"),
       aes(start.hour)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "dodgerblue",width = 0.75) +
  facet_wrap(~start.day,ncol = 2) +
  scale_x_discrete(breaks = seq(0,24,2)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank())
```

## Session information

This is the version of R and the packages that were used to generate
these results.

```{r session-info}
