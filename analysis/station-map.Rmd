```

In this analysis, I will use the Divvy trip and station data to
generate a map of Chicago. 

I begin by loading a few packages, as well as some additional
functions I wrote for this project.

```{r load-packages, message = FALSE}
library(data.table)
library(ggplot2)
source("../code/functions.R")
```

## Read the data

As [before](first-glance.html), I use function `read.divvy.data` to
read the trip and station data from the CSV files.

```{r load-data}
divvy <- read.divvy.data()
```

## Get total number of departures by station

I use the trip data to get the total number of departures by station.
From these data, I create a "departures" column.

```{r count-departures}
divvy$stations <-
  cbind(divvy$stations,
    data.frame(departures = as.vector(table(divvy$trips$from_station_id))))
summary(divvy$stations$departures)
```

## Create a Divvy stations map

A plot of the Divvy stations by geographic location (latitude and
longitude) traces the outlines of the City of Chicago and the Lake
Michigan shore. Further, the location of the downtown is apparent by
scaling the area of each circle by the number of trips.

The University of Chicago Divvy station is highlighted in red.

```{r create-stations-map, fig.width=6.5, fig.height=7.5}
divvy$stations <-
  transform(divvy$stations,
            at.uchicago = (name == "University Ave & 57th St"))
ggplot(divvy$stations,aes(x    = longitude,
                          y    = latitude,
                          fill = at.uchicago,
                          size = sqrt(departures))) +
  geom_point(shape = 21,color = "white") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("darkblue","red")) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank())
```
