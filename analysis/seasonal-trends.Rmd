In this last notebook, I use the Divvy trip data to examine biking
trends in Chicago over the course of one year.

I begin by loading a few packages, as well as some additional
functions I wrote for this project.

```{r load-packages, message = FALSE}
library(data.table)
library(ggplot2)
source("../code/functions.R")
```
<br>

## Read the data

First, I read in the Divvy trip and station data from the CSV files.

```{r load-data, cache = TRUE}
divvy <- read.divvy.data()
```

I would like to analyze city-wide departures for each day of the year,
so I create a new "day of year" column.

```{r day-of-year}
divvy$trips <-
  transform(divvy$trips,
    start.dayofyear = factor(as.numeric(format(divvy$trips$starttime,"%j")),
                             1:366))
```

I also convert the "start week" column to a factor to make it easier
to compile trip statistics for each week in the year.

```{r convert-start-week}
divvy$trips <-
  transform(divvy$trips,
  start.week      = factor(start.week,0:52))
```
<br>

## Plot departures per day and per week

Here, I compile a vector containing the number of trips taken in each
day of the year, and then I plot these numbers.

```{r plot-trips-by-day, fig.height = 3, fig.width = 5}
counts.day <- as.vector(table(divvy$trips$start.dayofyear))
ggplot(data.frame(day = 1:366,departures = counts.day),
       aes(x = day,y = departures)) +
  geom_point(color = "darkblue",shape = 19,size = 1) +
  geom_line(color = "darkblue") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0,350,25)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank())
```

There is sizeable increase in trips during summer days, but since the
number of trips varies widely from one day to the next, I think the
plot will look nicer if instead we count the number of trips taken in
each week of the year.

```{r plot-trips-by-week, fig.height = 3, fig.width = 5}
counts.week <- as.vector(table(divvy$trips$start.week))
ggplot(data.frame(week = 0:52,departures = counts.week),
       aes(x = week,y = departures)) +
  geom_point(color = "darkblue",shape = 19,size = 1.5) +
  geom_line(color = "darkblue") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank())
```

Indeed, the seasonal trends are more clear in this plot; most of the
trips are taken when the weather is better (weeks 20--40), and very
few people are using the Divvy bikes in the cold winter months.

## Seasonal trends at the University of Chicago

When we analyze trips taken at the University of Chicago Divvy bike
station, the "bump" during warmer months flattens out. This is
probably because a large fraction of the students leave during the
summer.

```{r plot-trips-by-week-uchicago, fig.height = 3, fig.width = 5}
dat <- subset(divvy$trips,from_station_name == "University Ave & 57th St")
counts.week.uchicago <- as.vector(table(dat$start.week))
ggplot(data.frame(week = 0:52,departures = counts.week.uchicago),
       aes(x = week,y = departures)) +
  geom_point(color = "darkblue",shape = 19,size = 1.5) +
  geom_line(color = "darkblue") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank())

```

This is the version of R and the packages that were used to generate
these results.
